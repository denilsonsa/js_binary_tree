# js_binary_tree

Quite old code (from 2006) to simulate a simple binary tree in JavaScript.
Uses no extra libraries, just plain JavaScript and W3C DOM.
The code was originally written before I knew what was "version control
system", and only recently I've imported the old code into this repository.

Live demo available at <http://denilsonsa.github.io/js_binary_tree/simple_binary_tree.html>
